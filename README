Very basic chroma keying. Has not (yet) any blur or color correction or whatsoever

This keying addon uses the chroma key method. There is also an addon for color differencing. That produces better results but only works with a green background and a really well lit environement. https://github.com/underdoeg/ofxGreenscreen
